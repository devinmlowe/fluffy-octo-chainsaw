> This repository is intended to host various CSS snippets for the purpose of learning and sandboxing.

## Initial Project

I use the Shortcuts app extensively in iOS for various tasks, some of which output Markdown that I usually like to preview in my browser. I have been using [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) to enrich how that output is displayed, but recently I have become disatisified with the stock CSS that it outputs. So my goals are to create a CSS style that adds on to the capabilities of Markdeep by:

1. Rendering everything in a style similar to the Everforest theme that is available in Obsidian.
2. Making everything easier to read on a mobile device.
3. Improving the printed output when sent to a physical print device
